        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This is a collection of scripts I use to manage all of my radio plays, add tags with additional information to them (like author, director, description, artists etc.) and provide a web-frontend to play plays and organize playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's written in a mix of script languages (mostly to leran python, but resulting in multiple implementation of stuff in both, python and perl).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main purposes of this script collections:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The python-scripts in directory <code>Python</code> try to keep your hard disc in sync with any files on a (read-only) ftp-server.<br />
                    You can specify a list of files or directories to ignore when syncing.<br />
                    It detects identical files and hard-links those files to save disc space. It tries to detect renamed files on the ftp-site and creates hard links as well and deletes renamed files, if they don't exist on the ftp-site anymore.<br />
                    The main goal is to keep as much data as possible - but use no more space than needed (Files are never deleted - only overwritten if there it was updated on the ftp-server).<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    The perl and js scripts reside in directory <code>wui</code> (web user interface) and provide a simple web server and some js files to be run at the client.<br />
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>
            I tried to keep the configuration in separate files (mostly to prevent my ftp-credentials from being published).<br />
            You should find sample configuration files in <code>Python/Config.py.sample</code> and <code>wui/wui.conf.sample</code>. Copy both files to the same directory by removing the <code>.sample</code> extension and make apropriate changes. That should be all needed...
